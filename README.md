# DESCRIPTION
Program 2 asks the user to input 10 integer values, they were stored. The program then was to find the sum of the
values, find the maximum value, and then reverse the entries and display them in that order. I had trouble finding
the maximum value, as well as figuring out how to traverse the array in reverse order using the MIPS language.

# PSUEDO-CODE
- println("Enter 10 values: ");
- for (i < array.length){
-	myArray[i] = user_input.next
-	println("These are tge values " + myArray[i]);
- sum=0;
- for(i < array.length){
- sum += myArray[i]
- }
- int max = myArray[0]
- for (i < myArray.length )
-	if( mA[i] > max)
-		max = mA[i]
